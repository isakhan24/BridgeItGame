# BridgeItGame
Project for ICS3U.
Two player game where one player inputs a secret word and the other tries to guess it letter by letter.
For every right answer they move farther along the bridge, for every wrong answer the bridge collapses.
If you make it across you win! If the bridge breaks under you, you lose.
